In the summer term 2025, Jonas Heintze and I are organizing a student's reading group on Higher Algebra as the follow up to the [reading group on Infinity Categories](https://jonasheintze.gitlab.io/teaching/readinggroup.html). For a regularly updated [syllabus](https://yordantoshev.github.io/HAStuSemSum25Bonn/syllabus.pdf), klick the violet badge above! We assume basic knowledge of infinity categories as in the first six chapters of Ferdinand Wagner's [notes](https://github.com/FlorianAdler/inftyCats). If you wish to participate, you can email us or attend the preliminary meeting!

### Concept
As can be seen in the syllabus, each session is split into two, meaning that two people will be talking each week. In this way, we hope to reduce the load on each single one of us and force ourselves to engage more with the material, as the preparation would require discussing with a partner. The exact time distribution can be decided by each pair of speakers individually. Preferably, try to prepare a talk for about an hour each.
As this reading group is not connected to any credit points and no grade, everyone is encouraged to ask as many questions as they like, to create a good learning atmosphere. Nobody is expected to have answers to every question, but we want to find solutions together.

### Organization
Monday 18:15, Seminarroom tbd. The first meeting will be 07th of April.

### Additional Material
Something might appear here later.
