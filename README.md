In the summer term 2025, Jonas Heintze and I are organizing a student's reading group on Higher Algebra as the follow up to the [reading group on Infinity Categories](https://jonasheintze.gitlab.io/teaching/readinggroup.html). For the [syllabus](https://yordantoshev.github.io/HAStuSemSum25Bonn/syllabus.pdf), klick the violet badge above! We assume basic knowledge of infinity categories as in the first six chapters of Ferdinand Wagner's [notes](https://github.com/FlorianAdler/inftyCats). If you wish to participate, you can email us or attend the preliminary meeting!
